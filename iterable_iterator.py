An ITERABLE is:

anything that can be looped over (i.e. you can loop over a string or file) or
anything that can appear on the right-side of a for-loop: for x in iterable: ... or
anything you can call with iter() that will return an ITERATOR: iter(obj) or
an object that defines __iter__ that returns a fresh ITERATOR, or it may have a __getitem__ method suitable for indexed lookup.
An ITERATOR is an object:

with state that remembers where it is during iteration,
with a __next__ method that:
returns the next value in the iteration
updates the state to point at the next value
signals when it is done by raising StopIteration
and that is self-iterable (meaning that it has an __iter__ method that returns self).
Notes:

The __next__ method in Python 3 is spelt next in Python 2, and
The builtin function next() calls that method on the object passed to it.
For example:

>>> s = 'cat'      # s is an ITERABLE
                   # s is a str object that is immutable
                   # s has no state
                   # s has a __getitem__() method

>>> t = iter(s)    # t is an ITERATOR
                   # t has state (it starts by pointing at the "c"
                   # t has a next() method and an __iter__() method

>>> next(t)        # the next() function returns the next value and advances the state
'c'
>>> next(t)        # the next() function returns the next value and advances
'a'
>>> next(t)        # the next() function returns the next value and advances
't'
>>> next(t)        # next() raises StopIteration to signal that iteration is complete
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
StopIteration

>>> iter(t) is t   # the iterator is self-iterable
